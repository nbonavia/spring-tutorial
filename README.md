# Spring Tutorial
This is a github project that is used to illustrate the features of Spring Framework

There are 4 branches in this tutorial, each branch provides an incremental approach towards a Rest API written in Java that Users Spring Dependency Injection Framework and uses hibernate to connect to an ORM layer.

 - Step_1-DI: This is an implementation of a console application that uses Spring Framework's Dependency Injection Mechanism
 - Step_2-ORM: This is an implementation of a console application that uses Spring Framework's Dependency Injection together with hibernate ORM framework to interact with the database.
 - Step_3-API: This is an implementation of a Spring Boot Web Application that provides a REST API integration that exposes the ORM layer implemented in Step 2 over REST

After cloning this repository, you can switch between branches using the following commands: -

## Step 1: Dependency Injection ##
`git checkout Step_1-DI`

## Step 2: ORM ##
`git checkout Step_2-ORM`

## Step 3: API ##
`git checkout Step_3-API`

Once the branch is switched, read the branch's README.md file for specific branch documentation
