# spring
This is a github project that is used to illustrate the features of Spring Framework

There are 4 branches in this tutorial, each branch provides an incremental approach towards a Rest API written in Java that Users Spring Dependency Injection Framework and uses hibernate to connect to an ORM layer.

 - Step_1-DI: This is an implementation of a console application that uses Spring Framework's Dependency Injection Mechanism
 - Step_2-ORM: This is an implementation of a console application that uses Spring Framework's Dependency Injection together with hibernate ORM framework to interact with the database.
 - Step_3-API: This is an implementation of a Spring Boot Web Application that provides a REST API integration that exposes the ORM layer implemented in Step 2 over REST
 - Step_4-OPENSHIFT: This is an implementation of The REST API layer that could be deployed on Redhat Openshift. As a side-note, Redhat Openshift have recently updated their cloud solution so it's very likely that the changes might break this deployment.
